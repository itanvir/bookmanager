# bookmanager
A book manager web app developed with FLASK and SQL database

At its most simple, the app will allow users to create new books, read all the existing books, update the books, and delete them. These operations – create, read, update, and delete – are more commonly known as "CRUD" and form the basis of nearly all web applications. 

Usage:  
python app.py

If we execute python app.py command, and direct our browser to http://localhost:5000/books, we should see a list of books.
